# Quotes - (Extended)

An extension of the Quotes Java Appkication. 

## Description
When running the application, donâ€™t read in the quotes file. Instead, make a request to an API to get a random quote.
* Formismatic: no API key required, visit http://api.forismatic.com/api/1.0/?method=getQuote&format=json&lang=en to get random quotes

Rather than a Quote of the Day, please use an API that allows you to show a random quote.
